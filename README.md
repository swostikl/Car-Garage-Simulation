# üöó Car-Garage Simulation (Java)
The Car Garage Simulation is a Java-based application that models the operations of a modern automotive garage. This object-oriented program demonstrates key Java concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, collections, and exception handling while simulating real-world garage operations.

# Overview
Car garages manage complex operations involving multiple vehicles, each requiring different services such as maintenance, repair, or inspection. Managing these operations manually can lead to inefficiency, errors and delayed service. The ‚ÄúCar Garage Simulation‚Äù project aims to digitally model these operations with specialized service.


# üåü Features
* Simulate customers arriving at the garage at fixed time intervals.  
* Process customers through **Customer Service**, **Inspection**, and **Maintenance**.  
* Maintenance includes **Tire Change, Oil Change, and Repair Work**.  
* Queue management for Inspection and Maintenance.  
* Re-inspection loop for cars that fail inspection.  
* Track when customers are served and exit the system.

# Simulation Instructions
1. Download the .jar file from the latest [release](https://github.com/swostikl/Car-Garage-Simulation/releases).
2. Run the JAR file with JDK or JRE 21 ([get Temurin JDK or JRE version 21](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases?version=21&os=any&arch=any))
3. Open the Simulator and load the Setup Window.
4. Enter the required input Parameters.
5. Adjust the inspection failure rate and speed if necessary.
6. Click Run to start the simulation.
7. Observe the real-time process in the Simulation window.
8. Use the Stepper Control Window to pause, resume, or step through events.
9. Once the simulation completes, the result view will automatically appear when the simulation exits.
10. Interpret the performance data and adjust parameters for further experiment.
